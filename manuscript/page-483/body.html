My brother disciples and I joyously sang the refrains, beating time with our hands.</p><p>By sunset we had served our hundreds of visitors with khichuri (rice and lentils), vegetable curry, and rice pudding. We laid cotton blankets over the courtyard; soon the assemblage was squatting under the starry vault, quietly attentive to the wisdom pouring from Sri Yukteswar's lips. His public speeches emphasized the value of Kriya Yoga, and a life of self-respect, calmness, determination, simple diet, and regular exercise.</p><p>A group of very young disciples then chanted a few sacred hymns; the meeting concluded with sankirtan . From ten o'clock until midnight, the ashram residents washed pots and pans, and cleared the courtyard.</p></div> </div>
