I added a warning whose truth I felt intuitively: "Unless you mend your ways, someday you will be asked to leave this ashram."</p><p>Laughing sarcastically, Kumar repeated my remark to our guru, who had just entered the room. Fully expecting to be scolded, I retired meekly to a corner.</p><p>"Maybe Mukunda is right." Master's reply to the boy came with unusual coldness. I escaped without castigation.</p><p>A year later, Kumar set out for a visit to his childhood home. He ignored the quiet disapproval of Sri Yukteswar, who never authoritatively controlled his disciples' movements. On the boy's return to Serampore in a few months, a change was unpleasantly apparent. Gone was the stately Kumar with serenely glowing face.</p></div> </div>
