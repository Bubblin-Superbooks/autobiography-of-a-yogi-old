<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Divine shapes of saints, sitting in meditation posture in mountain caves, formed like miniature cinema pictures on the large screen of radiance within my forehead.</p><p>"Who are you?" I spoke aloud.</p><p>"We are the Himalayan yogis." The celestial response is difficult to describe; my heart was thrilled.</p><p>"Ah, I long to go to the Himalayas and become like you!" The vision vanished, but the silvery beams expanded in ever-widening circles to infinity.</p><p>"What is this wondrous glow?"</p><p>"I am Iswara. I am Light." The voice was as murmuring clouds.</p></div> </div>
