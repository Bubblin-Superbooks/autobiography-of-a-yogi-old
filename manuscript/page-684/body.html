The Supreme Spirit, the Uncreated, is wholly unconditioned (neti, neti not this, not that) but is often referred to in Vedanta as Sat-Chit-Ananda, that is, Being-Intelligence-Bliss.</p><p>Sometimes called Shankaracharya. Acharya means "religious teacher." Shankara's date is a center of the usual scholastic dispute. A few records indicate that the peerless monist lived from 510 to 478 B.C.; Western historians assign him to the late eighth century A.D. Readers who are interested in Shankara's famous exposition of the Brahma Sutraswill find a careful English translation in Dr. Paul Deussen's System Of The Vedanta (Chicago: Open Court Publishing Company, 1912). Short extracts from his writings will be found in Selected Works Of Sri Shankaracharya (Natesan & Co., Madras).</p></div> </div>
