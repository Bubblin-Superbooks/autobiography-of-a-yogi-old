<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I followed Bhaduri Mahasaya to his austere quarters on the top floor, from which he seldom stirred. Masters often ignore the panorama of the world's ado, out of focus till centered in the ages. The contemporaries of a sage are not alone those of the narrow present.</p><p>"Maharishi, you are the first yogi I have known who always stays indoors."</p><p>"God plants his saints sometimes in unexpected soil, lest we think we may reduce Him to a rule!"</p><p>The sage locked his vibrant body in the lotus posture. In his seventies, he displayed no unpleasing signs of age or sedentary life. Stalwart and straight, he was ideal in every respect. His face was that of a rishi, as described in the ancient texts. Noble-headed, abundantly bearded, he always sat firmly upright, his quiet eyes fixed on Omnipresence.</p></div> </div>
