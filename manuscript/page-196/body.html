My friend, Upendra Mohun Chowdhury, spoke impressively.</p><p>I gave him an enthusiastic smile. "Perhaps I can guess his name. Was it Bhaduri Mahasaya, of Upper Circular Road?"</p><p>Upendra nodded, a little crestfallen not to be a news-bearer. My inquisitiveness about saints was well-known among my friends; they delighted in setting me on a fresh track.</p><p>"The yogi lives so close to my home that I often visit him." My words brought keen interest to Upendra's face, and I made a further confidence.</p></div> </div>
