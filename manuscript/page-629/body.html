"Mukunda is a bit over-drunk with religion."

The judgment passed by my fellow students was expressed in their nickname for me-"Mad Monk."</p><p>I took an ingenious step to nullify Professor Ghoshal's threat to me of failure in philosophy. When the results of the final tests were about to be publicly announced, I asked a classmate to accompany me to the professor's study.</p><p>"Come along; I want a witness," I told my companion. "I shall be very much disappointed if I have not succeeded in outwitting the instructor."</p></div> </div>
