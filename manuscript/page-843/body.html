"How you love to bother me! As if you could not have come here by the next train!"</p><p>Abhoya visited Lahiri Mahasaya on another memorable occasion. This time she wanted his intercession, not with a train, but with the stork.</p><p>"I pray you to bless me that my ninth child may live," she said. "Eight babies have been born to me; all died soon after birth."</p><p>The master smiled sympathetically. "Your coming child will live. Please follow my instructions carefully. The baby, a girl, will be born at night. See that the oil lamp is kept burning until dawn. Do not fall asleep and thus allow the light to become extinguished."</p></div> </div>
