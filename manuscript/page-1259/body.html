At these words I felt Master melting away within my encircling arms.</p><p>"My child," his voice rang out, vibrating into my very soul-firmament, "whenever you enter the door of nirbikalpa samadhiand call on me, I shall come to you in flesh and blood, even as today."</p><p>With this celestial promise Sri Yukteswar vanished from my sight. A cloud-voice repeated in musical thunder: "Tell all! Whosoever knows by nirbikalpa realization that your earth is a dream of God can come to the finer dream-created planet of Hiranyaloka, and there find me resurrected in a body exactly like my earthly one. Yogananda, tell all!"</p></div> </div>
