His regular discourses on the scriptures came to be called his "Gita Assembly," eagerly attended by many truth-seekers.</p><p>By these manifold activities, Lahiri Mahasaya sought to answer the common challenge: "After performing one's business and social duties, where is the time for devotional meditation?"
