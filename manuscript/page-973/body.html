<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Sri Ananda Mohan Lahiri, a grandson of the master, has written an interesting booklet on Kriya. "The text of the Bhagavad Gita is a part of the great epic, the Mahabharata, which possesses several knot- points (vyas-kutas)," Sri Ananda wrote. "Keep those knot-points unquestioned, and we find nothing but mythical stories of a peculiar and easily-misunderstood type. Keep those knot-points unexplained, and we have lost a science which the East has preserved with superhuman patience after a quest of thousands of years of experiment. It was the commentaries of Lahiri Mahasaya which brought to light, clear of allegories, the very science of religion that had been so cleverly put out of sight in the riddle of scriptural letters and imagery. No longer a mere unintelligible jugglery of words, the otherwise unmeaning formulas of Vedic worship have been proved by the master to be full of scientific significance. . . .</p></div> </div>
