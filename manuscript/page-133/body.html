'Win conviction of God's presence through your own joyous contact in meditation.'</p><p>"No matter what the disciple's problem, the guru advised Kriya Yoga for its solution.</p><p>"'The yogic key will not lose its efficiency when I am no longer present in the body to guide you. This technique cannot be bound, filed, and forgotten, in the manner of theoretical inspirations. Continue ceaselessly on your path to liberation through Kriya, whose power lies in practice.'</p><p>"I myself consider Kriya the most effective device of salvation through self-effort ever to be evolved in man's search for the Infinite."
