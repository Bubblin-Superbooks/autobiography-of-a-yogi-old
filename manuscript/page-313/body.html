The "guru" Mukunda had to shoulder the responsibility of two unsought disciples in one day.</p><p>Breakfast the following morning was eaten in a harmony absent the day before.

White marble dazzling in the sun, it stands a vision of pure symmetry. The perfect setting is dark cypress, glossy lawn, and tranquil lagoon. The interior is exquisite with lacelike carvings inlaid with semiprecious stones. Delicate wreaths and scrolls emerge intricately from marbles, brown and violet. Illumination from the dome falls on the cenotaphs of Emperor Shah-Jahan and Mumtaz Mahall, queen of his realm and his heart.</p></div> </div>
