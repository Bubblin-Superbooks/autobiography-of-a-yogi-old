Master had often stopped to chat with her during his morning walk. On the evening of March 16, 1936, Ma arrived at the ashram and asked to see her guru.</p><p>"Why, Master died a week ago!" Swami Sebananda, now in charge of the Puri hermitage, looked at her sadly.</p><p>"That's impossible!" She smiled a little. "Perhaps you are just trying to protect the guru from insistent visitors?"</p></div> </div>
