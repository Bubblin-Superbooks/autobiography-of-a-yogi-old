<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Sitting one evening in this tranquil haven, I was pouring out my heart in song. Under my fingers was the sweet-toned organ of the church, on my lips the yearning plaint of an ancient Bengali devotee who had searched for eternal solace:</p><p>In this world, Mother, none can love me; In this world they do not know love divine. Where is there pure loving love? Where is there truly loving Thee? There my heart longs to be.</p><p>My companion in the chapel, Dr. Lloyd Kennell, the San Diego center leader, was smiling a little at the words of the song.</p><p>"Tell me truly, Paramhansaji, has it been worth it?" He gazed at me with an earnest sincerity.</p></div> </div>
