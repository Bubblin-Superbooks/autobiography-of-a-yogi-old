<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I left India in August, 1920, on The City Of Sparta, the first passenger boat sailing for America after the close of World War I. I had been able to book passage only after the removal, in ways fairly miraculous, of many "red-tape" difficulties concerned with the granting of my passport.</p><p>During the two-months' voyage a fellow passenger found out that I was the Indian delegate to the Boston congress.</p><p>"Swami Yogananda," he said, with the first of many quaint pronunciations by which I was later to hear my name spoken by the Americans, "please favor the passengers with a lecture next Thursday night. I think we would all benefit by a talk on 'The Battle of Life and How to Fight It.'"</p></div> </div>
