The following evening I set out for the train; on the way, at seven o'clock, a black astral cloud suddenly covered the sky. Later, while the train roared toward Puri, a vision of Sri Yukteswar appeared before me. He was sitting, very grave of countenance, with a light on each side.</p><p>"Is it all over?" I lifted my arms beseechingly.</p><p>He nodded, then slowly vanished.</p><p>As I stood on the Puri train platform the following morning, still hoping against hope, an unknown man approached me.</p><p>"Have you heard that your Master is gone?" He left me without another word; I never discovered who he was nor how he had known where to find me.</p></div> </div>
