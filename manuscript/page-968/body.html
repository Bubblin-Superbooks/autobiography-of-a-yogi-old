<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A number of Lahiri Mahasaya's disciples with influential worldly position were desirous of expanding the Kriya circle by publicity. The guru refused his permission. One chela, the royal physician to the Lord of Benares, started an organized effort to spread the master's name as "Kashi Baba" (Exalted One of Benares). Again the guru forbade it.</p><p>"Let the fragrance of the Kriya flower be wafted naturally, without any display," he said. "Its seeds will take root in the soil of spiritually fertile hearts."</p><p>Although the great master did not adopt the system of preaching through the modern medium of an organization, or through the printing press, he knew that the power of his message would rise like a resistless flood, inundating by its own force the banks of human minds. The changed and purified lives of devotees were the simple guarantees of the deathless vitality of Kriya.</p></div> </div>
