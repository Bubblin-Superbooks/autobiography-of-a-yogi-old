<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"I live by God's light." How simple her reply, how Einsteinian!</p><p>"I see you realize that energy flows to your body from the ether, sun, and air."</p><p>A swift smile broke over her face. "I am so happy to know you understand how I live."</p><p>"Your sacred life is a daily demonstration of the truth uttered by Christ: 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.'"</p><p>Again she showed joy at my explanation. "It is indeed so. One of the reasons I am here on earth today is to prove that man can live by God's invisible light, and not by food only."</p></div> </div>
