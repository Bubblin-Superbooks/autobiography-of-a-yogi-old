<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Our little group returned to the ashram in time for a good-night glimpse of Gandhi, enfolded in peace and correspondence.</p><p>Night was still lingering when I rose at 5:00 A.M. Village life was already stirring; first a bullock cart by the ashram gates, then a peasant with his huge burden balanced precariously on his head. After breakfast our trio sought out Gandhi for farewell pronams. The saint rises at four o'clock for his morning prayer.</p><p>"Mahatmaji, good-by!" I knelt to touch his feet. "India is safe in your keeping!"</p><p>Years have rolled by since the Wardha idyl; the earth, oceans, and skies have darkened with a world at war. Alone among great leaders, Gandhi has offered a practical nonviolent alternative to armed might.</p></div> </div>
