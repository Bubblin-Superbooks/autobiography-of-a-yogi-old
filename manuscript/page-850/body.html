<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>As Sri Yukteswar finished the awesome story, one of the spellbound listeners ventured a question that, from a child, was doubly understandable.</p><p>"Sir," he said, "why did your guru use castor oil?"</p><p>"Child, giving the oil had no meaning except that I expected something material and Lahiri Mahasaya chose the near-by oil as an objective symbol for awakening my greater faith. The master allowed Rama to die, because I had partially doubted. But the divine guru knew that inasmuch as he had said the disciple would be well, the healing must take place, even though he had to cure Rama of death, a disease usually final!"</p><p>Sri Yukteswar dismissed the little group, and motioned me to a blanket seat at his feet.</p></div> </div>
