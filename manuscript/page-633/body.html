<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"Divine Mother," I prayed, "wilt Thou not spiritually change my sister's husband?"</p><p>The beautiful figure, hitherto silent, spoke at last: "Thy wish is granted!"</p><p>I looked happily at Satish. As though instinctively aware that some spiritual power was at work, he rose resentfully from his seat on the ground. I saw him running behind the temple; he approached me, shaking his fist.</p><p>The all-embracing vision disappeared. No longer could I see the glorious Goddess; the towering temple was reduced to its ordinary size, minus its transparency. Again my body sweltered under the fierce rays of the sun. I jumped to the shelter of the pillared hall, where Satish pursued me angrily. I looked at my watch. It was one o'clock; the divine vision had lasted an hour.</p></div> </div>
