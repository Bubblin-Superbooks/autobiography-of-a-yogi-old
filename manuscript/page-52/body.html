<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Our family moved to Lahore in the Punjab. There I acquired a picture of the Divine Mother in the form of the Goddess Kali. It sanctified a small informal shrine on the balcony of our home. An unequivocal conviction came over me that fulfillment would crown any of my prayers uttered in that sacred spot. Standing there with Uma one day, I watched two kites flying over the roofs of the buildings on the opposite side of the very narrow lane.</p><p>"Why are you so quiet?" Uma pushed me playfully.</p><p>"I am just thinking how wonderful it is that Divine Mother gives me whatever I ask."</p><p>"I suppose She would give you those two kites!" My sister laughed derisively.</p></div> </div>
