<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Utter confusion of mind came upon me.</p><p>"Lord," I prayed, "am I dead or alive?"</p><p>A dazzling play of light filled the whole horizon. A soft rumbling vibration formed itself into words:</p><p>"What has life or death to do with Light? In the image of My Light I have made you. The relativities of life and death belong to the cosmic dream. Behold your dreamless being! Awake, my child, awake!"</p><p>As steps in man's awakening, the Lord inspires scientists to discover, at the right time and place, the secrets of His creation. Many modern discoveries help men to apprehend the cosmos as a varied expression of one power-light, guided by divine intelligence.</p></div> </div>
