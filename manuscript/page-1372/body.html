<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"I have never had any children; many years ago I became a widow. I sleep very little, as sleep and waking are the same to me. I meditate at night, attending to my domestic duties in the daytime. I slightly feel the change in climate from season to season. I have never been sick or experienced any disease. I feel only slight pain when accidentally injured. I have no bodily excretions. I can control my heart and breathing. I often see my guru as well as other great souls, in vision."</p><p>"Mother," I asked, "why don't you teach others the method of living without food?"</p><p>My ambitious hopes for the world's starving millions were nipped in the bud.</p></div> </div>
