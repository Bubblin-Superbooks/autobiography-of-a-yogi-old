<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>scene. The gaunt ground, the skyey roof, the caves offering primitive shelter-all seemed a gracious natural setting for the seraphic saints around me.</p><p>"I sat that afternoon on my blanket, hallowed by associations of past- life realizations. My divine guru approached and passed his hand over my head. I entered the nirbikalpa samadhistate, remaining unbrokenly in its bliss for seven days. Crossing the successive strata of self- knowledge, I penetrated the deathless realms of reality. All delusive limitations dropped away; my soul was fully established on the eternal altar of the Cosmic Spirit. On the eighth day I fell at my guru's feet and implored him to keep me always near him in this sacred wilderness.</p></div> </div>
