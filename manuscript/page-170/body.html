I could do it today if necessary." He gave a childlike laugh. "You look upon tigers as tigers; I know them as pussycats."</p><p>"Swamiji, I think I could impress my subconsciousness with the thought that tigers are pussycats, but could I make tigers believe it?"</p><p>"Of course strength also is necessary!
