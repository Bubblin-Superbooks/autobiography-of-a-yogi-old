<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"Why are you averse to organizational work?"</p><p>Master's question startled me a bit. It is true that my private conviction at the time was that organizations were "hornets' nests."</p><p>"It is a thankless task, sir," I answered. "No matter what the leader does or does not, he is criticized."</p><p>"Do you want the whole divine channa (milk curd) for yourself alone?" My guru's retort was accompanied by a stern glance. "Could you or anyone else achieve God-contact through yoga if a line of generous- hearted masters had not been willing to convey their knowledge to others?" He added, "God is the Honey, organizations are the hives; both are necessary. Any form is useless, of course, without the spirit, but why should you not start busy hives full of the spiritual nectar?"</p></div> </div>
