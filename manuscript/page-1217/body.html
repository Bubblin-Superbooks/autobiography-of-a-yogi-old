<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"A man identifies himself about sixteen hours daily with his physical vehicle. Then he sleeps; if he dreams, he remains in his astral body, effortlessly creating any object even as do the astral beings. If man's sleep be deep and dreamless, for several hours he is able to transfer his consciousness, or sense of I-ness, to the causal body; such sleep is revivifying. A dreamer is contacting his astral and not his causal body; his sleep is not fully refreshing."</p><p>I had been lovingly observing Sri Yukteswar while he gave his wondrous exposition.</p><p>"Angelic guru," I said, "your body looks exactly as it did when last I wept over it in the Puri ashram."</p></div> </div>
