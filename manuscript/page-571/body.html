<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>As Sri Yukteswar, a modern Yogi-Christ, reached the spot where Dijen and I were speechlessly rooted, Master smiled at my friend and remarked:</p><p>"I sent you a message too, but you were unable to grasp it."</p><p>Dijen was silent, but glared at me suspiciously. After we had escorted our guru to his hermitage, my friend and I proceeded toward Serampore College. Dijen halted in the street, indignation streaming from his every pore.</p><p>"So! Master sent me a message! Yet you concealed it! I demand an explanation!"</p><p>"Can I help it if your mental mirror oscillates with such restlessness that you cannot register our guru's instructions?" I retorted.</p></div> </div>
