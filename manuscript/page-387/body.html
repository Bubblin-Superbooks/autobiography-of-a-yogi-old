<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"Do you know the Bhagavad Gita?"</p><p>"No, sir, not really; though my eyes and mind have run through its pages many times."</p><p>"Thousands have replied to me differently!" The great sage smiled at Master in blessing. "If one busies himself with an outer display of scriptural wealth, what time is left for silent inward diving after the priceless pearls?"</p><p>Sri Yukteswar directed the study of his own disciples by the same intensive method of one-pointedness. "Wisdom is not assimilated with the eyes, but with the atoms," he said. "When your conviction of a truth is not merely in your brain but in your being, you may diffidently vouch for its meaning." He discouraged any tendency a student might have to construe book-knowledge as a necessary step to spiritual realization.</p></div> </div>
