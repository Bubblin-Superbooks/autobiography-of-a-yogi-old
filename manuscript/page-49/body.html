It was many hours before Lahiri Mahasaya broke his silence with a pregnant comment:</p><p>"I am Spirit. Can your camera reflect the omnipresent Invisible?"</p><p>"I see it cannot! But, Holy Sir, I lovingly desire a picture of the bodily temple where alone, to my narrow vision, that Spirit appears fully to dwell."</p><p>"Come, then, tomorrow morning. I will pose for you."</p><p>Again the photographer focused his camera. This time the sacred figure, not cloaked with mysterious imperceptibility, was sharp on the plate. The master never posed for another picture; at least, I have seen none.</p></div> </div>
