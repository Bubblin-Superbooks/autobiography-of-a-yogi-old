His voice was cold, his manner unemotional.</p><p>"Yes, dear Master, I am here to follow you." Kneeling, I touched his feet.</p><p>"How can that be? You ignore my wishes."</p><p>"No longer, Guruji! Your wish shall be my law!"</p><p>"That is better! Now I can assume responsibility for your life."</p><p>"I willingly transfer the burden, Master."</p><p>"My first request, then, is that you return home to your family. I want you to enter college in Calcutta. Your education should be continued."</p></div> </div>
