He often lay down, without even a pillow, on a narrow davenport which was the background for his customary tiger-skin seat.</p><p>A night-long philosophical discussion was not rare; any disciple could summon it by intensity of interest. I felt no tiredness then, no desire for sleep; Master's living words were sufficient. "Oh, it is dawn! Let us walk by the Ganges." So ended many of my periods of nocturnal edification.</p><p>My early months with Sri Yukteswar culminated in a useful lesson-"How to Outwit a Mosquito."
