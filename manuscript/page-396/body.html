Complete immobility is usually one's sole hope of safety.</p><p>Lahiri Mahasaya actually said "Priya" (first or given name), not "Yukteswar" (monastic name, not received by my guru during Lahiri Mahasaya's lifetime). (See .) "Yukteswar" is substituted here, and in a few other places in this book, in order to avoid the confusion, to reader, of two names.</p><p>"Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them."-Mark 11:24.
