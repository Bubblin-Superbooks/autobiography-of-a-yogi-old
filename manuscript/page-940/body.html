Lahiri Mahasaya had appeared to instruct the chela in answer to his prayers.</p><p>If a disciple neglected any of his worldly obligations, the master would gently correct and discipline him.</p><p>"Lahiri Mahasaya's words were mild and healing, even when he was forced to speak openly of a chela's faults," Sri Yukteswar once told me. He added ruefully, "No disciple ever fled from our master's barbs." I could not help laughing, but I truthfully assured Sri Yukteswar that, sharp or not, his every word was music to my ears.</p></div> </div>
