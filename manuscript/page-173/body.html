Through pressure of instincts from past lives, strengths or weaknesses percolate gradually into human consciousness. They express as habits, which in turn ossify into a desirable or an undesirable body. Outward frailty has mental origin; in a vicious circle, the habit-bound body thwarts the mind. If the master allows himself to be commanded by a servant, the latter becomes autocratic; the mind is similarly enslaved by submitting to bodily dictation."</p><p>At our entreaty, the impressive swami consented to tell us something of his own life.</p><p>"My earliest ambition was to fight tigers. My will was mighty, but my body was feeble."</p><p>An ejaculation of surprise broke from me.
