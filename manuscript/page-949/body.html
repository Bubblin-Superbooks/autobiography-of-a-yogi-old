<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"Thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness." In these words to John the Baptist, and in asking John to baptize him, Jesus was acknowledging the divine rights of his guru.</p><p>From a reverent study of the Bible from an Oriental viewpoint, and from intuitional perception, I am convinced that John the Baptist was, in past lives, the guru of Christ. There are numerous passages in the Bible which infer that John and Jesus in their last incarnations were, respectively, Elijah and his disciple Elisha. (These are the spellings in the Old Testament. The Greek translators spelled the names as Elias and Eliseus; they reappear in the New Testament in these changed forms.)</p></div> </div>
