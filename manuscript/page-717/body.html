<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Kriya Yoga has nothing in common with the unscientific breathing exercises taught by a number of misguided zealots. Their attempts to forcibly hold breath in the lungs is not only unnatural but decidedly unpleasant. Kriya, on the other hand, is accompanied from the very beginning by an accession of peace, and by soothing sensations of regenerative effect in the spine.</p><p>The ancient yogic technique converts the breath into mind. By spiritual advancement, one is able to cognize the breath as an act of mind-a dream-breath.</p><p>Many illustrations could be given of the mathematical relationship between man's respiratory rate and the variations in his states of consciousness.</p></div> </div>
