His freedom is final and immediate, if he so wills; it depends not on outer but inner victories.</p><p>Sri Yukteswar discovered the mathematical application of a 24,000-year equinoctial cycle to our present age. The cycle is divided into an Ascending Arc and a Descending Arc, each of 12,000 years. Within each Arc fall four Yugas or Ages, called Kali , Dwapara , Treta , and Satya , corresponding to the Greek ideas of Iron, Bronze, Silver, and Golden Ages.</p><p>My guru determined by various calculations that the last KaliYuga or Iron Age, of the Ascending Arc, started about A.D. 500. The Iron Age, 1200 years in duration, is a span of materialism; it ended about A.D. 1700.</p></div> </div>
