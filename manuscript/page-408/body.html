"Observing a complete fast, I prayed for the recovery of your Uncle Sarada from a chronic malady. On the seventh day I found a herb materialized in my hand! I made a brew from the leaves, and gave it to your uncle. His disease vanished at once, and has never reappeared."</p><p>I entered the sacred Tarakeswar shrine; the altar contains nothing but a round stone.
