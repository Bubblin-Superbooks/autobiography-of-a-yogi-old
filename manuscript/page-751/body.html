<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Sometime after Swami Pranabananda had visited Ranchi, I accompanied my father to the Calcutta house where the yogi was temporarily staying. Pranabananda's prediction, made to me so many years before, came rushing to my mind: "I shall see you, with your father, later on."</p><p>As Father entered the swami's room, the great yogi rose from his seat and embraced my parent with loving respect.</p><p>"Bhagabati," he said, "what are you doing about yourself? Don't you see your son racing to the Infinite?" I blushed to hear his praise before my father. The swami went on, "You recall how often our blessed guru used to say: 'Banat, banat, ban jai.' So keep up Kriya Yoga ceaselessly, and reach the divine portals quickly."</p></div> </div>
