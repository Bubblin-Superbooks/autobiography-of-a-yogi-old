My saintly tutor recounted the story one day, his eyes remote from the Sanskrit texts before us.</p><p>"A blind disciple, Ramu, aroused my active pity. Should he have no light in his eyes, when he faithfully served our master, in whom the Divine was fully blazing? One morning I sought to speak to Ramu, but he sat for patient hours fanning the guru with a hand-made palm-leaf punkha. When the devotee finally left the room, I followed him.</p><p>"'Ramu, how long have you been blind?'</p><p>"'From my birth, sir! Never have my eyes been blessed with a glimpse of the sun.'</p></div> </div>
