<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"I don't understand."</p><p>"Patanjali's meaning was the removal of desire to kill." Sri Yukteswar had found my mental processes an open book. "This world is inconveniently arranged for a literal practice of ahimsa. Man may be compelled to exterminate harmful creatures. He is not under similar compulsion to feel anger or animosity. All forms of life have equal right to the air of maya. The saint who uncovers the secret of creation will be in harmony with its countless bewildering expressions. All men may approach that understanding who curb the inner passion for destruction."</p><p>"Guruji, should one offer himself a sacrifice rather than kill a wild beast?"</p></div> </div>
