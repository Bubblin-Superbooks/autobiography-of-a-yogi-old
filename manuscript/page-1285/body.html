The Gandhi vow of non-possession came early in his married life. Renouncing an extensive legal practice which had been yielding him an annual income of more than $20,000, the Mahatma dispersed all his wealth to the poor.</p><p>Sri Yukteswar used to poke gentle fun at the commonly inadequate conceptions of renunciation.</p><p>"A beggar cannot renounce wealth," Master would say.

He did not renounce wealth and love; they renounced him!"</p></div> </div>
