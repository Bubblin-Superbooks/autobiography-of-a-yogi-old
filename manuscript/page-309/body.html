<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"Dear friends, will you not honor my home for a visit?"</p><p>"You are kind; but the plan is unfeasible. Already we are guests of my brother in Agra."</p><p>"At least give me memories of touring Brindaban with you."</p><p>I gladly consented. The young man, who said his name was Pratap Chatterji, hailed a horse carriage. We visited Madanamohana Temple and other Krishna shrines. Night descended while we were at our temple devotions.</p><p>"Excuse me while I get sandesh." Pratap entered a shop near the railroad station. Jitendra and I sauntered along the wide street, crowded now in the comparative coolness. Our friend was absent for some time, but finally returned with gifts of many sweetmeats.</p></div> </div>
