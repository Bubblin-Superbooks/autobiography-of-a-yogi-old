<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The wonders of the motion picture, of radio, of television, of radar, of the photo- electric cell-the all-seeing "electric eye," of atomic energies, are all based on the electromagnetic phenomenon of light.</p><p>The motion picture art can portray any miracle. From the impressive visual standpoint, no marvel is barred to trick photography. A man's transparent astral body can be seen rising from his gross physical form, he can walk on the water, resurrect the dead, reverse the natural sequence of developments, and play havoc with time and space. Assembling the light images as he pleases, the photographer achieves optical wonders which a true master produces with actual light rays.</p><p>The lifelike images of the motion picture illustrate many truths concerning creation. The Cosmic Director has written His own plays, and assembled the tremendous casts for the pageant of the centuries.</p></div> </div>
