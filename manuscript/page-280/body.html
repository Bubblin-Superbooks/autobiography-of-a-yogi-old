<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>My relationship with Dyananda's followers grew steadily worse. The household was alienated, hurt by my determined aloofness. My strict adherence to meditation on the very Ideal for which I had left home and all worldly ambitions called forth shallow criticism on all sides.</p><p>Torn by spiritual anguish, I entered the attic one dawn, resolved to pray until answer was vouchsafed.</p><p>"Merciful Mother of the Universe, teach me Thyself through visions, or through a guru sent by Thee!"</p><p>The passing hours found my sobbing pleas without response. Suddenly I felt lifted as though bodily to a sphere uncircumscribed.</p><p>"Thy Master cometh today!" A divine womanly voice came from everywhere and nowhere.</p></div> </div>
