Come here to me."</p><p>Snubbed and exposed, I made my way sadly to his side.</p><p>"Poor boy, the mountains couldn't give what you wanted." Master spoke caressively, comfortingly. His calm gaze was unfathomable. "Your heart's desire shall be fulfilled."</p><p>Sri Yukteswar seldom indulged in riddles; I was bewildered. He struck gently on my chest above the heart.</p><p>My body became immovably rooted; breath was drawn out of my lungs as if by some huge magnet. Soul and mind instantly lost their physical bondage, and streamed out like a fluid piercing light from my every pore. The flesh was as though dead, yet in my intense awareness I knew that never before had I been fully alive.</p></div> </div>
