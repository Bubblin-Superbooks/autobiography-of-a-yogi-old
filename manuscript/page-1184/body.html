These beings dwell in the gloom-drenched regions of the lower astral cosmos, working out their evil karma.</p><p>"In the vast realms above the dark astral prison, all is shining and beautiful. The astral cosmos is more naturally attuned than the earth to the divine will and plan of perfection. Every astral object is manifested primarily by the will of God, and partially by the will- call of astral beings.</p></div> </div>
