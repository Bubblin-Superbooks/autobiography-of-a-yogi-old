<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Sitting on my bed in the Bombay hotel at three o'clock in the afternoon of June 19, 1936-one week after the vision of Krishna-I was roused from my meditation by a beatific light. Before my open and astonished eyes, the whole room was transformed into a strange world, the sunlight transmuted into supernal splendor.</p><p>Waves of rapture engulfed me as I beheld the flesh and blood form of Sri Yukteswar!</p><p>"My son!" Master spoke tenderly, on his face an angel-bewitching smile.</p><p>For the first time in my life I did not kneel at his feet in greeting but instantly advanced to gather him hungrily in my arms. Moment of moments! The anguish of past months was toll I counted weightless against the torrential bliss now descending.</p></div> </div>
