One day, however, I took a problem to Master.</p><p>"I want to know, sir-when shall I find God?"</p><p>"You have found Him."</p><p>"O no, sir, I don't think so!"</p><p>My guru was smiling. "I am sure you aren't expecting a venerable Personage, adorning a throne in some antiseptic corner of the cosmos! I see, however, that you are imagining that the possession of miraculous powers is knowledge of God. One might have the whole universe, and find the Lord elusive still!
