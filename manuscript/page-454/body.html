<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I asked Sri Yukteswar that evening to explain the incident which had, I thought, a few baffling features.</p><p>My guru shook his head slowly. "You will understand it someday. Science will soon discover a few of these hidden laws."</p><p>When the wonders of radio burst some years later on an astounded world, I remembered Master's prediction. Age-old concepts of time and space were annihilated; no peasant's home so narrow that London or Calcutta could not enter! The dullest intelligence enlarged before indisputable proof of one aspect of man's omnipresence.</p><p>The "plot" of the cauliflower comedy can be best understood by a radio analogy. Sri Yukteswar was a perfect human radio. Thoughts are no more than very gentle vibrations moving in the ether.</p></div> </div>
