<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> There in a small attic room I engaged in daily meditations and prepared my mind for the divine search.</p><p>The memorable morning arrived with inauspicious rain. Hearing the wheels of Amar's carriage in the road, I hastily tied together a blanket, a pair of sandals, Lahiri Mahasaya's picture, a copy of the Bhagavad Gita, a string of prayer beads, and two loincloths. This bundle I threw from my third-story window. I ran down the steps and passed my uncle, buying fish at the door.</p><p>"What is the excitement?" His gaze roved suspiciously over my person.</p><p>I gave him a noncommittal smile and walked to the lane. Retrieving my bundle, I joined Amar with conspiratorial caution. We drove to Chadni Chowk, a merchandise center. For months we had been saving our tiffin money to buy English clothes.</p></div> </div>
