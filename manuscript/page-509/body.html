During the 4800 years of SatyaYuga , final age in an ascending arc, the intelligence of a man will be completely developed; he will work in harmony with the divine plan.</p><p>A descending arc of 12,000 years, starting with a descending Golden Age of 4800 years, then begins for the world; man gradually sinks into ignorance. These cycles are the eternal rounds of maya , the contrasts and relativities of the phenomenal universe. Man, one by one, escapes from creation's prison of duality as he awakens to consciousness of his inseverable divine unity with the Creator.</p></div> </div>
