<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"I am here, Guruji." My shamefacedness spoke more eloquently for me.</p><p>"Let us go to the kitchen and find something to eat." Sri Yukteswar's manner was as natural as if hours and not days had separated us.</p><p>"Master, I must have disappointed you by my abrupt departure from my duties here; I thought you might be angry with me."</p><p>"No, of course not! Wrath springs only from thwarted desires. I do not expect anything from others, so their actions cannot be in opposition to wishes of mine. I would not use you for my own ends; I am happy only in your own true happiness."</p></div> </div>
