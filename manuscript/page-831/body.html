Please drink it."</p><p>Trailanga unhesitatingly drained, to the last drop, the containerful of burning lime.

"Scoffer," he said, "you did not realize when you offered me poison that my life is one with your own. Except for my knowledge that God is present in my stomach, as in every atom of creation, the lime would have killed me. Now that you know the divine meaning of boomerang, never again play tricks on anyone."</p></div> </div>
