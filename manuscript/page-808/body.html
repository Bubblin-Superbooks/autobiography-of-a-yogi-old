<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The New York Timesgave the following report of a 1937 demonstration of the electron microscope before a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science:</p><p>"The crystalline structure of tungsten, hitherto known only indirectly by means of X-rays, stood outlined boldly on a fluorescent screen, showing nine atoms in their correct positions in the space lattice, a cube, with one atom in each corner and one in the center. The atoms in the crystal lattice of the tungsten appeared on the fluorescent screen as points of light, arranged in geometric pattern. Against this crystal cube of light the bombarding molecules of air could be observed as dancing points of light, similar to points of sunlight shimmering on moving waters. . . .</p></div> </div>
