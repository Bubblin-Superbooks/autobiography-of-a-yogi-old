<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Southern India, rich with historical and archaeological remains, is a land of definite and yet indefinable charm. To the north of Mysore is the largest native state in India, Hyderabad, a picturesque plateau cut by the mighty Godavari River. Broad fertile plains, the lovely Nilgiris or "Blue Mountains," other regions with barren hills of limestone or granite. Hyderabad history is a long, colorful story, starting three thousand years ago under the Andhra kings, and continuing under Hindu dynasties until A.D. 1294, when it passed to a line of Moslem rulers who reign to this day.</p><p>The most breath-taking display of architecture, sculpture, and painting in all India is found at Hyderabad in the ancient rock- sculptured caves of Ellora and Ajanta.</p></div> </div>
