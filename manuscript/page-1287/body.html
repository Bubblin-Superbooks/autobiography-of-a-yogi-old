Her sanctity is intense; she is known far and wide as Ananda Moyi Ma (Joy- Permeated Mother)." My niece, Amiyo Bose, gazed at me earnestly.</p><p>"Of course! I want very much to see the woman saint." I added, "I have read of her advanced state of God-realization. A little article about her appeared years ago in East-West."</p><p>"I have met her," Amiyo went on. "She recently visited my own little town of Jamshedpur. At the entreaty of a disciple, Ananda Moyi Ma went to the home of a dying man. She stood by his bedside; as her hand touched his forehead, his death-rattle ceased. The disease vanished at once; to the man's glad astonishment, he was well."</p></div> </div>
